The original patents are the most detailed form of "original" documentation that I have been able to find. The patents I
have been able to find are:
- US3996562 and its "patent family": This patent describes the logical structure of the Mathatron and its algorithms.
    There are various patents in multiple countries with essentially the same content, this is known as a "patent
    family". I recommend [US4611307](./patents/US4611307-mathatron-latest.pdf) as the "default version", as this is the
    latest US version of the patent. The US version is least likely to have been "garbled in the translation", and
    earlier versions (especially the original version) contain some errata that have been fixed in later versions[^1].
    Some other members of the family can be useful for special purposes, e.g. the scans of the British patents have
    better resolution on the scanned plots than the US version. A full list of the patent family can be found using a
    "full" patent search engine, e.g. the EU "Espacenet" or the German "DEPATISnet"[^2].
- [US3304858](./patents/US3304858-printer.pdf): This patent describes the printer unit of the Mathatron. The description
    of the control logic may be useful; the timing information does not fully match the Arithmeum machine.
- [US3438011](./patents/US3438011-shift-register.pdf): This patents describes the unusual core memory used by the
    Mathatron, and was essential in understanding it. The values match those seen in the Arithmeum machine.
- [US3502787](./patents/US3502787-bobbin.pdf): This patent describes the "bobbin" construction method used for the
    processor logic. Unless you are planning a repair for which the mechanical construction of the bobbins is relevant
    this is probably not useful for practical work on the Mathatron.

[^1]: US3996562 contains a list of known errata. Some of them are minor typos that are easy to ignore when reading the
    patent, but there is also some errors in the example computation which can cause much confusion.
[^2]: The links produced by both of these do not seem to be very "shareable", so you will need to run the search
    yourself.
